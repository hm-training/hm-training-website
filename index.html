        HM TRAINING provides customized sports and coaching services for all your physical activities.
        HM TRAINING  uses a responsible and planned approach for the best results. Losing your ability to engage in
        sporting activities because of an inappropriate training approach or an injury is a setback that can have a
        significant impact on your overall wellness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to long term success for all your daily and sporting activities is the “know how”. The human body is
        complex, fascinating and capable of much more than you could imagine, no matter when you start training or your
        current level of fitness. Working concurrently as a qualified physiotherapist at KINETIEK BVBA, Harold has a
        unique knowledge of anatomy which allows him to develop an individual approach for each athlete and client,
        which is indispensable for successful training.
      </p>
      <p>
        HM TRAINING stands for a wide variety of sport activities: it can go from post-injury start to move to different
        kinds of individual training programs whether athletic (e.g 20km of Brussels, a Marathon, swim-run challenge,
        triathlon or any other sport) or just get fit/keep fit. Our training programs also cover Thai boxing, running,
        swimming, surfing, basketball, football or cycling. So you can see that a wide variety of trainings are available
        (for all kinds of sport challenges with different options) to suit your objectives and timetables.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you start running, weightlifting or if you just want to improve your technique or pace, we are happy to
        answer any questions, or to provide advice. Whether it’s your first-time back on the move or you’re a long-time
        athlete and/or fitness practitioner, HM TRAINING will guide you with the necessary advice and program: postural
        guidelines, daily workouts, strength-stretch and cardio programs to the rescue!
      </p>
      <p>
        You can train with HM TRAINING in English, Dutch and French.
