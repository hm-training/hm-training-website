          <blockquote>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i><br>
            I have been training for 31 years. Over the years, I developed some physical and mechanical problems with my
            body that inhibited my training. My doctor recommended a personal trainer who understood human anatomy.
            I tried and rejected many trainers. I am happy to report that Harold Marreyt, with whom I have been training
            for over a year, possesses truly excellent qualities for a personal trainer even for those without specific
            injuries. He is a qualified physiotherapist. In addition, he is an excellent personal trainer, motivating
            and patient, while reassuring at the same time. His sessions are varied and never exactly the same thing.
            Harold has a lovely temperament and engaging personality, giving each client the impression that he has all
            the time in the world to devote to their fitness. I wholeheartedly recommend Harold as a personal trainer."

            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i><br>
            I met Harold about 6 years ago when he treated me for a dislocated shoulder. He was the very first personal
            trainer I had worked with. After my recovery, I asked him to help me lower my fat percentage and build more
            muscle. His knowledge of the human body combined with an amazing training program gave spectacular results
            for me. I started at 24% body fat, badly in shape. With a consistent training and useful tips for nutrition,
            I was at 15%, still going down. He developed for me a good work ethic that I still use to this day. Whenever
            I travel abroad for projects and meet other personal trainers, his lessons remain and help me to get a head
            start. He doesn’t train you just to get fit, he also teaches you how to avoid injury and how to move in
            everyday life. He is also a skilled thai boxer and I enjoyed learning the basics with him. Great trainer,
            great experience, great guy."
